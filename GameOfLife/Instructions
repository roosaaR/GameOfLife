Game of Life

This project is my C++ implementation of Conway's Game of Life.
Game of Life is a zero-player game, and the progress of the game depends on
its initial state that user can decide by clicking cells alive.
The game is a two-dimensional grid that consists of the same sized
square cells.Every cell has eight neighbours and the game progresses
in states, which are determined by the amount of alive neighbour cells.

Rules:

- If the cell is dead, it will turn alive if it has exactly three neighbours.
- If the cell is alive, it will turn dead if it has 1 or no neighbours.
- If the cell is alive, it will turn dead if it has 4 or more neighbours.
- If the cell is alive and it has 2 or 3 neighbours, it will remain alive.

How to play:

When the program starts, it creates a 15 x 15 board of initially dead
grey cells. If the user wants to change the grid size, it can be done
by choosing a new value between 15 and 40 from the spinbox. Game starts
when user clicks a New Game button. After that the user can set the initial
state of the game by clicking cells, when the clicked cells turn purple.
When the user is happy with the initial state, the user can choose to run
the game either sequentially by pressing the Next button multiple times
or just pressing Start button and the game starts to progress automatically.
The user can also first use the Next button and switch to automatic mode,
if desired. The game ends if all the cells turn back grey. The game can also
stay running continuously until the user presses the Clear Button and ends
the game. User can start a new game by pressing the New Game button.
